# Beta Testing

When beta testing Valheim (either locally or connecting to a beta Valheim Dedicated Server), your client install of Valheim must be set up to allow for the testing version of the game. 

**If you have any local world saves, make sure to save backups of them to a safe location outside of the Valheim local install folder before starting this process**

- Open your Steam Game Library, right click on Valheim and select **Properties**.

- Go to the **Betas** section. In the Private Betas field, add the access code below and click **Check Code**. A message should appear saying you can now opt-in to the public testing beta installs.
